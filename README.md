Why I want to work in the team:
------------------------------
- I am really interested in coding, DL and the concept of EVs. I have worked in a CFI club and a competition team, and I really like the work culture. The motive for me to join Abhiyaan's software module is the use the combined skills I've learnt as a part of Avishkar and CVI. Also, as an ED student in Automotive Engineering, Abhiyaan would really help me improve my skills.
